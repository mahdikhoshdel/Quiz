### Customizable True/False Quiz with Tkinter UI
This project features a True/False quiz implemented with a user-friendly Tkinter interface. Users can define their own questions within the program, and the system checks their answers against the associated data stored in a separate file. With this setup, users can easily add or remove questions to customize their quiz experience.
